High bandwidth.	

File system used in S3:

Network File System (NFS) and Server Message Block (SMB).

Features:

- REAL - TIME SCENARIO - 90% Auto-backup system - storage class
- 99.999999999% Durability.
- 99.99% Availability.

LIMITATIONS:
------------

- CANNOT INSTALL SOFTWARES/OS
 UPTO 5TB OBJECT I CAN STORE ON MY SINGLE ACCOUNT

Functions & Concepts of S3:

COMPONENTS OF S3:
-----------------
1. BUCKET - Dir/folder/filesystem
2. OBJECT - Files

Buckets:
- A basic storage unit.
- Collection of Objects.
- It is a single level container, can contain multiple folders, or objects can be placed directly.
- Upload and download are easier.
- Name of the bucket should be globally unique.
- Allows maximum 100 buckets per user.
- No size restriction for Bucket.
- Data kept secured from unauthorized access through authentication mechanism. SSL (Key)

Objects:
- Equivalent to files.
- Allows max of 5TB for a single object via multipart upload.
- Allows 5MB to 5 GB size single put operation (Free tier)


How to Access AWS S3 storage?
Accessible using simple HTTP URLs
https://s3.amazonaws.com/bucket/folder/key

where bucket is a DNS CNAME record pointing to s3.amazonaws.com)

Bucket Versioning:
-----------------
Delete marker - if you delete on delete marker you can retrieve your original object
Permanent deletion of the object - delete all versions

STORAGE CLASS:
-------------
1. STANDARD FREQUENT ACCESS : UPFRONT ADVANCE COLLECTED FOR BOTH STORE / RETRIEVE .. >=3   
2. STANDARD INFREQUENT ACCESS DATA -  >=30 >=3 AZ'S    ... UPFRONT ADVANCE FOR STORE ... RETRIVEAL - COST - PER GB
3. ONE ZONE IA - >=30 DAYS, >=1 , PER GB 
4. REDUCED_REDUCNDANCY : >=60 DAYS, PER GB - CRITICAL , INFREQUET ACCESS  - PER GB
5. INITELLIGENT-TIERING - >=3 ZONES   ... MONITORING COST 
6. GLACIER >=90 DAYS - VERY VERY LOW >=3 PER GB   - 1 MIN 12 MINTS 
7. DEEP GACIER ARCHIVE >=180DAYS - ZIP ...>=3 ... PER GB 3 TO 12 HOURS 
365 day i can make my test object to be expired 


OBJECT LEVEL PROPERTIES:
1. DETAILS: 
STANDARD: 99.99999999%
STAND.INFREQUENT: LESSER THAN STANDARD.
Reduced Redundancy: 99.99% , LESSER THAN S.IA.

AES 256 - ADVANCED ENCRYPTION STANDARD.

Static web hosting

Object Lock - we can enable while creating the bucket after we cant

Bucket name must be between 3 and 63 characters long
